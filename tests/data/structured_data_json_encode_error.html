	  "recipeIngredient": ["Squash",
"2 small butternut squash, cut in half lengthwise and seeds removed",
"2&frac12; tablespoons olive oil",
"1&frac14; cups corn kernels ",
"Filling",
"1 cup quinoa",
"2 cups water or vegetable broth",
"One 14-ounce can chickpeas, drained",
"1 bunch scallions, thinly sliced",
"1 cup chopped roasted red peppers",
"&frac12; cup chopped fresh parsley",
"1 cup chopped hazelnuts",
"? cup olive oil",
"&frac14; cup apple cider vinegar",
"1 tablespoon Dijon mustard",
"Salt and freshly ground black pepper",
"? cup shredded Gruyère cheese"],
	  "recipeInstructions": "1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Prepare two baking sheets. 2. Make the Squash: Rub the inside of the butternut squash halves with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and then place the halves, cut sides down, on a baking sheet. Roast until the squash is just tender, 20 to 25 minutes. 3. Transfer the corn to the second baking sheet and drizzle with the remaining ½ tablespoon olive oil. Roast until the corn begins to turn golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. 4. Make the Filling: In a small pot, combine the quinoa and water or broth. Bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid is nearly gone and the quinoa is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. 5. Transfer the quinoa to a large bowl and toss with the roasted corn, chickpeas, scallions, red peppers, parsley and hazelnuts. 6. In a small bowl, whisk the olive oil with the vinegar and mustard to combine. Season with salt and pepper. 7. Add the dressing to the filling and toss well to coat. Arrange the filling inside the butternut squash halves. You can scoop out some of the cooked squash to make more room for the filling or you can just pile it on top. 8. Garnish each piece of squash with 2 tablespoons of the shredded Gruyère and then return to the oven until the cheese is melted and the filling is warm, 10 to 12 minutes more. 9. Serve warm, immediately."
